Prior to your appointment, you should download and fill out the necessary forms on our online patient forms page. While you are going through the intake session, you will also need to complete a series of forms and other paperwork to give us a general idea of your health history, present condition, recurring issues, and other information that will help in the creation of your initial records. Consent forms for examination and possible treatment will also need to be filled out.",

This is a one-on-one session where you can get to know the chiropractor, and he can learn more about you. You will talk about treatment alternatives and options, set a few goals, and be able to relay your expectations.",

    title: "Chiropractic Exam",
    body: "Following the consultation, you will receive an examination with a thorough assessment. This includes a battery of tests that allow for an evaluation of your flexibility, reflexes, orthopedic, postural, and neurological conditions. Depending on your initial assessment, X-rays may be taken to establish a baseline for treatment, standard protocol for certain conditions.",

    title: "Treatment and Wellness",

      "Because our clinic takes a holistic approach to care, our doctor will also recommend a wellness program to include into your treatment plan for better results. This program is designed by an entire team of wellness specialists and includes diet, exercise, and maintenance. The customized plan associated with your treatment will help you get back to your standard quality of life, or better!",
