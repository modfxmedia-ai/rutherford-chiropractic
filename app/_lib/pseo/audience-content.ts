 * targeted cities, and one of the 5 `PSEO_AUDIENCES` occupation/life-stage
 * angles from `audiences.ts`.
 *
 * Scale (25 conditions x 10 cities x 5 audiences = 1,250 pages) makes
 * hand-authoring every sentence impractical, so — like the original
 * fallback assembly in `content.ts` before `city-content.ts` overrides
 * existed — this builds every page from modular, factual fragments
 * (condition clinical data + real neighborhood descriptor + real audience
 * blurb) rather than literal duplicated copy. The condition-level lead and
 * "why choose us" bridge sentence are intentionally shared across a
 * condition's 50 audience pages (same pattern as the site's other
 * assembly-based pages); the neighborhood- and audience-specific sentences
 * and 2 of the 5 FAQs are unique to every (condition, city, audience)
 * combination.
