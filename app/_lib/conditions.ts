/**
 * Conditions We Treat — a new content taxonomy (not present on the live
 * WordPress origin) that groups specific medical conditions separately
 * from the existing 6 core Services (Chiropractic, Spinal Decompression,
 * Neuropathy, Sports Injuries, Auto Injuries, Back Pain Relief).
 *
 * Content is synthesized from real information already crawled from
 * rutherfordchiropractic.com's blog posts (see `scraped/html/`), grounded
 * in the clinic's actual whole-person, non-invasive, chiropractic +
 * spinal-decompression approach. This is NOT verbatim-copied text (no
 * single source page covers "Sciatica" or "Whiplash" as a structured
 * condition page on the live site), but every clinical claim traces back
 * to a real blog post already published on the origin domain.
 *
 * Each condition gets:
 *   - a homepage carousel card (name + shortDescription + icon)
 *   - a dedicated SEO page at /{slug}/ using `ConditionPageTemplate`
 *   - a "Conditions" nav dropdown entry (see `app/_ui/nav.ts`)

It builds from small, repeated movements and postures throughout the day - how you sit at a desk, bend to lift something, stand for long periods, or sleep at night can all quietly irritate the sciatic nerve.
